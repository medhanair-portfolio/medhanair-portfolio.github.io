                    <p>I am a media & journalism and anthropology double major at
                        UNC-Chapel Hill. I strive
                        to spotlight
                        untold
                        or
                        undertold stories. If these stories can impact at least one person, its purpose is complete.
                        The people I meet inspire me the most.

                    <p> My family is from Kerala, India and my parents immigrated to
                        Brooklyn,
                        New York in 2000 to start a new life. Since then they have been teaching me the intricacies of
                        the
                        world.
                        Gradually, from my first day of school, my first job, and my first year of college at Macaulay
                        Honors
                        College -- I have been exposed to people from all walks of life. That is what inspired me to
                        pursue
                        anthropology and telling stories has always been a passion. </p>

                    <p> Now, as a journalism student I wish to write
                        on a variety of topics and grow my skills to become a better writer. Multimedia projects are
                        also
                        something I wish to pursue because a good story deserves to be told in a variety of ways. As
                        a writer on
                        the
                        lifestyle
                        desk at the Daily Tar Heel, I wrote stories about the community from mental health clinics
                        to drag
                        shows. Now I write stories on the city and state desk.
