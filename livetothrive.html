        A girl named Alexandria Webb, played with her adored Ariel doll in
        Whiteville, North Carolina, at five years old as her single mother
        watched, knowing she would soon snatch away her daughter’s smile. A
        woman many years later, bridges a pathway of healing for her sisters
        undergoing abuse as a consultant at the Orange County Rape Crisis
        Center. An artist holding the experiences of her life, Alex Thee Rabbit,
        took the stage to perform in 2012. In her element and authentic to her
        art and to herself. “I saw a girl who wanted it.” Alexandria’s drag mom
        said in a hushed voice. “She wanted it so bad. She wanted better. She
        wanted more.” Alexandria called the “spirit of resistance” part of her
        family, and rather it is apparent in her life. Yet to get to her spirit,
        first you approach the unapologetic Black, Indigenous, and transgender
        woman that she is today. To be Alexandria is to have never been given a
        choice between subtle or authentic. To be Alexandria is to be an
        advocate because silence is harmful to her and her friends. To be
        Alexandria is to lack regression because to regress is to not survive in
        her world. So she has evolved. Ava Webb, a little mermaid hater? In
        1988, growing up as a Black woman in the small town of Bolton, North
        Carolina, minutes out from the coastal town of Wilmington, North
        Carolina, was very different than attending university at Appalachian
        State University in the mountains of Boone, North Carolina. But there
        was Ava Latonia Webb, unprepared for the cold winter climate and for her
        colder classmates. Now she had to protect herself and evolve. “We want
        to know what you are,” a group of white students asked Ava as they
        passed by her dorm in the second semester of her freshman year. “What do
        you mean, what I am?” Ava responded puzzled. “Well, you don't seem to be
        Black because you don't act like Black people act,” they said. “Well,
        how do Black people act?” Ava challenged. Evolve. “Well, you know, we
        were taught they all lie, and they cheat, and they steal and they're
        loud,” they said. Ava transferred to Winston-Salem State University
        after her freshman year. She stood in line for lunch at the dining hall
        when suddenly she felt a tug at her hair. A group of students had found
        it right to lift her hair to check how it looked below. Evolve. “I don't
        know what it is, but it sure is pretty,” a man flirted with Ava. Evolve.
        After her second year of university, Ava’s parents didn’t want to pay
        for tuition, so she was on her own. But she wanted it. She wanted to be
        a teacher, so she continued. She worked 35 hours a week and lived
        off-campus. Then she met Alexandria’s father, but he didn’t feel like
        being a dad. So, she was on her own again. About four months later, Ava
        graduated, pregnant and with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of
        Science in 1992. At this time, Ava moved back home. The Church Ava lived
        with her parents for the remainder of her pregnancy. Her dad was
        displeased, but her mom was joyous. Her maternal grandma was pleased,
        and her paternal grandma was ecstatic. But she had another home. Her
        first home was her parent’s house, and her second “home away from home”
        was her sweet maternal grandma’s. And her third was the church. Ava was
        raised as a church girl; she attended every Sunday. If there was no time
        for church, then there was no time for anything else. But the church
        quickly forgot about the work she would do every Sunday. The elders of
        the church demanded that she apologize in front of them for having a
        child outside of wedlock. Ava, despite her upbringing and the closeness
        to the Bolton Baptist Church, felt that there was no need to humiliate
        her openly, especially when she knew that nobody in a similar situation
        like hers was made to do that. Evolve. “Dad, could you take me to the
        hospital?” Ava asked as she leaked amniotic fluid from her very pregnant
        body. “Find somebody else to do it,” he replied. Evolve. On August 22,
        1992, Alexandria Webb was born under a different name. For the first
        couple of months, she was cared for by Ava’s aunt and mother while Ava
        was at work. Soon she met her first husband and moved away a couple
        miles from her parents. However, Ava experienced the last day with her
        first husband in the first year of Alexandria's life. Baby Alexandria
        was giggling in the arms of her beloved mom. But her mom was not
        laughing. Instead, her husband gripped Ava by her shoulders as he
        shouted and shook her body. Evolve. Ava went through phases as she
        cycled between pleasing her husband and raising her child, and those two
        things often clashed. Yet one thing was clear. Alexandria was and is her
        mom’s daughter. Both women were forced to self-advocate and evolve.
        Alexandria and Drag As a baby drag queen, she was allowed to explore
        Alexandria. She started in college at UNC-Chapel Hill, performing when
        she could. At that time her family recognized her as gay. But Alexandria
        was slowly discovering a new side to herself. The person she was
        assigned at birth had “no future,” but the person she truly was needed
        to start living. When Alexandria was 26 years old, she understood that
        her sexuality—which may have provided her a door into drag—was not the
        reason that she enjoyed adorning women’s clothes. Her coming out as
        transgender was not just her truth but her celebration. For the first
        time, Alexandria was known to the world as Alexandria. But the world was
        not so accepting. The outside perception was harsh. Alexandria wished,
        like others, that she had support from her family. However, her family
        grappled with accepting who she was. Despite being accepted by a lot of
        her family when she was in college as gay, Alexandria quickly realized
        that being a woman would be a lot different, even though it is her
        truest and closest identity. A first ‘coming out’ around 2010 As a
        teenager with internet access, exploring your sexuality also means
        exploring the web. And Alexandria didn’t do it so masterfully. Traces
        left behind on multiple computers led to confrontations from family
        members. In her mom’s memory, it was Ava’s second husband, Grant, who
        started mentioning it. From a young age, Alexandria watched her mom
        oblige some of his requests. He was bothered that she played with Barbie
        dolls and her favorite Disney princess dolls—Pocahontas and Ariel. Her
        Pocahontas doll was the first to go, tossed out the car window. Well,
        accidentally by Alexandria herself, but Ava couldn’t be bothered to go
        back and get it in traffic. Then Ariel was next; maybe Ava thought it
        was for some greater good, or maybe it was just for Grant, but what she
        was left with after all these years was regret. Then when she confronted
        her teenage daughter years later, Ava once again held regret. For the
        two of them, this marks the time a wall was slowly built between them.
        Although Alexandria doesn’t remember the confrontation so vividly. It
        was when she moved into Carmichael Residence Hall at UNC that she
        remembers telling Ava that she was gay. Things were better after that.
        The woman who raised her Thanksgiving Day in 2012, when Alexandria was
        in her junior year. She had a show at Flex, a gay bar and nightclub in
        Raleigh. For her, this was an important drag show, except she had one
        dilemma. She was in Whiteville with no car and the club was two hours
        away. So, that night ended up being the first performance that Ava ever
        attended as the pair drove to Raleigh together. It was an art to her,
        and she still remembers how people would come up to her knowing that she
        was Alexandria’s mom; some talked about how their parents don’t speak to
        them anymore and how it was so wonderful Ava was there supporting
        Alexandria as a drag artist. Then about seven years later, Alexandria
        and Ava were in their car at Lake Waccamaw in Columbus County. They
        discussed their regrets, and it was then that the daughter of Ava became
        a daughter to Ava. At that time, Alexandria didn’t insist on correcting
        any errors misgendering her, so it only became harder as she eventually
        tried doing so. “I do think she was overall upset when I finally decided
        to come out,” Alexandria said. “She's owned up to the fact that she's
        made a lot of mistakes. There are pivotal moments in my life where she
        feels like she could have gone back in time and helped me become more
        authentic to myself.” Ava has self-reflected and has had conversations
        with Alexandria that have helped her in understanding the true
        Alexandria. But it was cautious progress, and this period still left its
        mark. A second ‘coming out’ “Being trans was really a big celebration of
        myself and just what I wanted in general because it was one of the first
        things I did for myself,” Alexandria said. It was her friends she told
        first, and mostly they accepted her. They opened their arms for the
        woman they already knew was there. Then came the advice to embrace
        feminine clothing. Worn not only during drag shows but also to work, to
        the grocery store on a random weekday and the bar with her friends, to
        start living her life in her truth. Yet this time was inherently a
        turmoil for Alexandria, and she needed a focus. For a while, it was
        substances that she focused on. Hurt can come from many places, and for
        Alexandria, after she came out as transgender, hurt came from within her
        family. “Well, I can understand you being gay, but you being trans, I
        don't understand that, and I don't support that,” her aunt said.
        Alexandria was not "that"; she was her niece. Yet the acceptance of
        Alexandria was tainted by the way that some of the older family members
        were raised. Her grandfather was already homophobic, so being
        transgender left the two at odds with each other. When she showed up to
        Thanksgiving dinner with a dress and makeup, it was her uncle and
        grandfather who would try to prohibit her from expressing herself. She
        started medically transitioning alone; she attended appointments to
        start on hormone medication and gender-affirming care. And on the side,
        Alexandria would drink a lot in that period; she also contracted six
        reoccurring cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea. A second mother a daughter
        Alexandria would find solace amongst the sisterhood of drag queens who
        are also transgender. Kimora is Alexandria's drag mother, a term used
        usually about the person who introduced you to the drag scene. But for
        Alexandria and Kimora, the knowledge that Kimora brought as an older
        trans woman was priceless to Alexandria. Outside of drag, the two
        exchanged tips from an experienced woman to a relatively inexperienced
        one. “It went beyond,” Kimora said. “She's not my drag child. She's like
        an inspiration to me to keep going, because I saw myself in her as a
        daughter, as a trans person; I felt the need to nurture.” At the time,
        Kimora helped her grow more into herself. Now when Kimora is in town
        looking for a show, Alexandria is the first person to step up and help
        her look for one. Miss B Haven (performer name) is Alexandria’s drag
        daughter. The pair share a similar relationship. “I don't want her to
        have to go through the same things that I've had to go through,”
        Alexandria said. Even when it comes to difficult topics like drinking,
        Alexandria has stood her ground when communicating with Miss B Haven.
        When she drank too much, creating a toxic environment, it was Alexandria
        who stepped in and drew a boundary. She expressed deep care for Miss B
        Haven but also a strictness to show her that there were limits.
        Alexandria's experiences shape the way she navigates interactions with
        her drag daughter while she gradually discovers her identity. At Flex,
        Miss B Haven was out with friends when the host of the drag show that
        night directed a transphobic joke at her, attempting to invalidate her.
        This kind of comment affects transgender people in affirming their
        identity, so when she heard this, it felt like her identity was being
        attacked. It was Alexandria who, after the event, comforted her drag
        daughter but didn’t obscure the truth. It was she who told Miss B Haven,
        a transgender Mexican-American woman, that these comments happen, and in
        her mix of emotions, perhaps the lack of sugar-coating from Miss B
        Haven’s drag mother was all she needed at that moment. “Just like
        sharing with me the experience of we both being trans women, there are
        things that me and Alexandria can talk about and so much personal
        confidence that I couldn't just talk to like any other drag performer
        like that,” Miss B Haven said. The ‘spirit of resistance’ The “spirit of
        resistance” is present historically with the intertwining of Alexandria
        and her family’s roots as Black and part of the Waccamaw Siouan Tribe.
        The “spirit of resistance” is present intergenerationally in the life of
        Ava navigating absurdity as a Black woman in North Carolina. The “spirit
        of resistance” is present intragenerationally in Alexandria’s life as
        she pushes away the life that transgender women are told to have and
        pulls to her the life that she desires. Her spirit of resistance is both
        undeniable and unbreakable. Career Alexandria has worked many jobs since
        graduating; drag shows represent some of her income, but in the process
        of figuring out her identity, it reflected on different parts of her
        life. Now, 32-year-old Alexandria lives in Durham and has naturally
        fallen into advocacy. At UNC she was a political science major, but in
        the world, she has had to prove countless times to her family, to
        strangers and sometimes to friends, her proud identity as a woman. While
        having to prove yourself constantly inevitably leads to self-doubt, she
        takes feeling stable as a transgender woman in employment and otherwise
        as one of the most important goals. For Alexandria, she works at the
        Orange County Rape Crisis Center. There she serves as an LGBTQ client
        services advocate. Before that position, she helped form the QPOC Sexual
        Survivors Institute, which assists survivors that are LGBTQ and people
        of color through community advocates. “If I stick up for myself, then it
        only makes the world a better place for people like me,” Alexandria
        said. “So that's why when it gets really tough, sometimes I just think
        about that, and I'm like, you can't quit, because if you quit and
        several other people quit, it is just like the domino effect.” So she
        didn’t quit. She didn’t quit when her family made hurtful comments about
        her; she didn’t quit when her mom didn’t show up to her doctors’
        appointments; she didn't quit when a couple of drinks became many drunk
        nights; she didn't quit when dating men was overshadowed by the violence
        that many transgender women experience. She didn’t quit. 2024 marks the
        first year that Alexandria felt safe, secure and stable being herself.
        Through the stages of her life where she has lived and learned, being
        able to say her mom was on her side this Thanksgiving is the support she
        often thought wouldn’t happen. Now more than ever, Alexandria wants to
        “thrive.” Her story is an evolution of passion where she gets more
        passionate about being who she is the more she experiences.
